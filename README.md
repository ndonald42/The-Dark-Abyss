# Tuning towards the edge of a dark abyss: Implications of a tuning paradigm on the hierarchy between the weak and dark matter scales
It has recently been suggested that tuning towards the boundary of the positivity domain of the scalar potential may explain the separation between the electroweak scale and the unification scale in a grand unified theory. Here we explore the possibility that the same type of tuning might account for the generation of the electroweak scale from a much lighter dynamically generated scale in a dark sector. We present a model that realizes this idea and provides a proof of principle that the same dark sector can include a viable dark matter candidate. A PDF of the arXiv publication is provided in the repository.
